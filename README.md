## üîí **Security Considerations**

Given the potential sensitivity of healthcare data, robust security measures are implemented:

### **Data Privacy:**
- Ensuring compliance with regulations like **HIPAA, GDPR,** or other relevant standards.
- Implementing **end-to-end encryption** for secure communication and data storage.

### **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
- Using frameworks like **pydantic** for input validation.
- Sanitizing all inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

### **Dependency Management:**
- Regularly updating dependencies and using tools like **`pip-audit`**, **`Safety`**, and **`Bandit`** for vulnerability detection.

### **Access Controls & Authentication:**
- Implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
- Utilizing **OAuth2 or JWT** for secure authentication.

### **Logging & Monitoring:**
- Maintaining detailed logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Integrating tools like **Sentry** or **Prometheus** for real-time monitoring.
